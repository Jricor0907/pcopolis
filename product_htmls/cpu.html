      <p>The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of your computer. It is responsible for carrying out instructions from software and processing data.</p>
      <p>When choosing a CPU, it is important to consider the following factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Core count: The more cores a CPU has, the more tasks it can process simultaneously.</li>
        <li>Clock speed: The clock speed of a CPU determines how quickly it can process instructions.</li>
        <li>Cache size: The cache is a small amount of high-speed memory that the CPU uses to store frequently accessed data. A larger cache size can improve performance.</li>
        <li> TDP: The TDP (thermal design power) of a CPU is the maximum amount of heat that it can generate. It is important to make sure that your CPU cooler is able to dissipate enough heat to keep your CPU cool.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the most popular CPU brands include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intel</li>
        <li>AMD</li>
      </ul>
