          <h3>Memory</h3>
          <p>Memory is used to store data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. The more memory you
            have, the better your computer will be able to run multiple programs at the same time.</p>

          <h3>Storage</h3>
          <p>Storage is used to store data that you want to keep for long periods of time, such as documents, photos,
            and music. There are two main types of storage: hard drives and solid-state drives (SSDs). Hard drives are
            more affordable, but SSDs are faster and more reliable.</p>
